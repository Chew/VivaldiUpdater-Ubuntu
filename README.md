# VivaldiUpdater

For Ubuntu!

This gem is designed to help simplify the process of upgrading Vivaldi.

Currently only does releases, not snapshots.

## How to use

1) Install: `gem install vivaldiupdater-ubuntu`

2) Run: `vivaldiupdater`

3) Follow instructions :)

## Requirements

* Ubuntu Linux (I use 64-bit, not sure what happens when you don't)
* [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com)
* Ruby (I recommend [rvm](https://rvm.io))

It's unsure what will happen if these requirements are not met, let me know what happens so I can add checks for them.

## Arguments

There are currently no CLI Arguments, I will add options and a `-h` later.

## To-Do

* Add support for Snapshots
* Add option to clear downloaded version
* Add checks to verify all requirements are met
* Allow snapshots to be downloaded
* Add option to quit vivaldi
